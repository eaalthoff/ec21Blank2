        <p>The 2019-2020 academic year was a time of transitions, turbulence and major challenges that impacted our community profoundly. in the summer of 2019, Edgewood College president, Scott Flanagan, resigned from his position after serving the college for twenty years, and Sister Mary Ellen Gevelinger was introduced as the 8th college president. When she took charge, she inherited a large budget deficit, trends of declining enrollment, a significant need to reduce the size of the workforce, and opportunities to redefine the academic structure of the college. Administration began addressing each of these issues over the fall term; however, no one could have predicted what the spring semester had in store: two viruses which continue to plague our community & society.

Shortly thereafter, the Office of Student Activities and the Office of Student Diversity & Inclusion merged to establish the Office of Student Inclusion & Involvement.
